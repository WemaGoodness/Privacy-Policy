# Privacy Policy for Chattide

**Last updated:** October 24, 2025

Chattide ("the App") is developed and maintained by Goodness Wema ("we", "us", or "our"). This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and protect information when you use the App.

## Information We Collect

The App is designed to operate using the minimum data required for its core social features. We may collect:

- **Account information** such as your name, email address, and profile details that you provide when you sign up or update your account.
- **Usage information** including in-app actions (for example, posts, chats, or reactions) to deliver the App's functionality and to maintain a safe community.
- **Device information** such as device model, operating system, and app version to improve stability and performance.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

1. Provide, maintain, and improve the App's features.
2. Enable communication features such as messaging, media sharing, and audio/video capture.
3. Protect the security and integrity of the App, including fraud prevention, abuse detection, and troubleshooting.
4. Comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms of Service.

## Camera and Media Access

The App requests camera and media permissions solely to support user-initiated actions:

- **Camera access (`android.permission.CAMERA`)** is used when you capture photos or videos from within the App. No media is recorded or uploaded without your explicit action.
- **Microphone access (`android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO`)** is used only when capturing audio for video recordings initiated by you.
- **Media library access (`android.permission.READ_MEDIA_IMAGES`, `READ_MEDIA_VIDEO`, `READ_MEDIA_AUDIO`, and related storage permissions)** allows you to select existing photos, videos, or audio files to share with other users. The App does not scan or upload your media files automatically.

Captured or selected media is uploaded only after you confirm the action. You can revoke these permissions at any time in your device settings, although doing so may disable related features.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell your personal information. We may share information with:

- **Service providers** that help us operate the App (such as hosting, analytics, or customer support). These providers are bound by confidentiality obligations.
- **Law enforcement or regulators** when required to comply with applicable laws, regulations, or legal processes.

Aggregated or de-identified data may be used for analytics or product improvement and does not identify individual users.

## Data Retention

We retain personal information only for as long as necessary to provide the App, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. You can request deletion of your account by contacting us using the details below.

## Security

We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the information we process. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Children's Privacy

The App is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can delete it.

## Your Choices

Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, or delete your personal information, or to object to certain processing activities. To exercise these rights, contact us using the information below. You may also manage device-level permissions (such as camera access) through your device settings.

## International Transfers

Your information may be processed on servers located outside of your home country. By using the App, you consent to the transfer of information to countries that may have different data protection laws than your jurisdiction. We take steps to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place when information is transferred.

## Updates to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of material changes by posting the updated policy within the App or on this page and updating the "Last updated" date above. Continued use of the App after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
